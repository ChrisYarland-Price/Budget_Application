# Mini project - Budget Mobile Application Testing
## The task

We were tasked with testing a mobile app, in this instance it was **Budget Watch**. Using the **AGILE** methodology, we planned how to test the app; determined by the user stories on our kanban board.

As a group, we discussed how our Kanban board should be set out. The board consited of the following columns:

* **Priorities**: 1 being high and 3 being low
* Execute
* Review
* **Definition of done**: has the code been peer reviewed and has it been indented properly, implementing DRY.

The user stories assisted us in creating our test cases/conditions, which were priortised from 1-3; 1 being the test which tests the most functional aspect of the website. Each member of the group took responsibilty on which user story they wanted to complete.
